Does this work? It seems so. 

Anyways, this is the first post. Just got chatgpt to help me set up a github page. 
Think it might be more fun to try to redo it myself after having spent some time 
on reading up on the subject. 

Hopefully, this will be a blog where I can write posts, show of my projects, and perhaps 
even write something about non-tech related topics that interest me. 

We'll see how it goes! 

It seems to be a bit slow to update.
